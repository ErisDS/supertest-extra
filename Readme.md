# SuperTest Extra

See the https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest library for documentation.

This repo contains an experimental change to SuperTest 2.0.0, attempting to improve the errors returned from SuperTest.
The code is being tested in a private project, until it's ready for upstream

## Notes
  This respostitory contains some experiments with adding better error handing to [SuperTest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest)
  Inspired by [api-easy](https://github.com/flatiron/api-easy) minus vows coupling.
